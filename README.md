# Ping Pong ball

## Hey guys, I made my first successfull raylib game.

## I also integrate ImGui Gui in this game to learn how to learn the imgui integration and for the game UI(Ofcourse I can use raylib ui for this).

## You can run this code in any Ide (I used cmake for that but I don't exactly know it can run in all ide).

## For VSCode you can follow below steps:

- First, Install the cmake extension in vscode from vscode extension tab (if you haven't install it).

- Clone the project from here and open the folder in vscode.

- The popup appear at the bottom of the vscode to configure cmake or you can go to command pallete using ctrl + shift + p and search for cmake: configure.

- you can select the build option(debug or release) at the bottom left corner.

- After cmake complete the task search in the command pallete for cmake: build.

- After build process complete run the code from button at the bottom of the vscode.

## For Visual Studio

- Just clone the repositary and open the solution in visual studio and run program
